KNN

knn.py is simply implementation of KNN algorithm and its components.
knn_test.py is used to save average accuracy results by using functions from knn.py.
knn_plot.py is used to plot 10-Fold CV results that are saved by knn_test.py.
And after showing accuracy plot, it get input for best K, then prints test accuracy with this K.

You need to first run knn_test.py, then run knn_plot.py.
knn_plot.py will want you to enter input,for the best k, after closing accuracy plots.
After inputting, it will print test accuracy.

KMEANS

kmeans.py is simply implementation of kmeans algorithm and its components.
kmeans_test.py is used to save resulted clusters and objective function results.
kmeans_plot.py is used to plot resulted clusters.
You need to first run kmeans_test.py, then run kmeans_plot.py.
when running kmeans_plot,
For each dataset:
    it plots K and corresponding objection function result.
    Then it wants you to input the best K by using elbow method.
    After entering K, it will plot clusters view with this K.

HAC
hac.py is simply implementation of hac algorithm and its components.
hac_test.py is used to run hac algorithm and to save result of them for each configuration.
hac_plot.py is used to plot resulted clusters.
You need to first run hac_test.py, then run hac_plot.py.
When hac_plot.py is running, it will plot all cluster results sequentially.



GENERAL
I saved and loaded all .npy files in outs/ directory.
