functions in hmm.py are implemented, they can be tested by executing hmm_simple_tester.py

functions in nb.py are implemented, they can be tested by executing nb_simple_tester.py

To do TASK3, I write task.py
When executing it, it reads data from nb_data folder.
Then, consequently, prints the accuracy on test set.
