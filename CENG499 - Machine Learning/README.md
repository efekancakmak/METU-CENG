# CENG 499 - Introduction to Machine Learning

HW1 is about Artificial Neural Network to classify CIFAR-32 dataset images.

HW2 includes implementations of K-Nearest-Neigbor, K-Means and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithms.

HW3 includes two part: Using sk-learn for SVM and implementation of ID3 algorithm for Decision Trees.

HW4 includes implementation of Hidden Markov Model algorithms namely, Forward and Viterbi,  also text classification by Naive Bayes.
