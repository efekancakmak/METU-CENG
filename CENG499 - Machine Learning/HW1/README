To train models that I configured,
it is enough to run python executable "trains.py"
it will outputs in the text file "accuracies.txt"
it will calculate validation and test accuracy right after the training halts

For sanity check with untrained ANN,
it is enough to run python executable "sanity.py"
it will put outputs in stdout
